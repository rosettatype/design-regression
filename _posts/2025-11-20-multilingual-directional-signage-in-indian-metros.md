## Introduction

### Background to the study

This article examines the integration of Devanagari script within
multilingual and multi-script directional signage across India’s metro
networks. The analysis presented here builds upon my [previous work](#sn:sn1),
which explored the challenges of adapting Latin script wayfinding
principles to Devanagari in India’s multilingual public transport
systems. The current study highlights diverse approaches to script
prioritisation, typographic harmonisation, and spatial organisation
across nine operational metro systems: Pune, Nagpur, Bengaluru,
Hyderabad, Mumbai, Kolkata, Ahmedabad, Lucknow, and Delhi.

Selected from India’s 17 operational networks, these nine metro systems
offer a broad overview of multilingual signage whilst focusing on those
prominently using the Devanagari script in primary wayfinding. This
focus excludes systems with minimal Devanagari, such as Chennai (mostly
Tamil/English) and Kochi (infrequent Hindi). The selection includes
Lucknow, located within Uttar Pradesh (UP), and Delhi, whose metro
network extends significantly into the National Capital Region, serving
areas in UP (like Noida) as well as Haryana (like Gurgaon). With UP thus
represented by Lucknow and the Delhi system’s Noida connection, an
analysis of other state systems like Agra and Kanpur was deferred for
future study. In contrast, Bengaluru was included specifically to
illustrate the impact of language policy, given its removal of the
Devanagari script. The remaining systems (Pune, Nagpur, Hyderabad,
Mumbai, Kolkata, Ahmedabad) were selected as they fit within the scope
of the study, sufficient visual data was available, and they provide
geographical and linguistic diversity.

### Context and significance

The rapid expansion of metro systems in India’s urban centres has
necessitated multilingual and multi-script signage that consistently
integrates English (Latin script), a regional language (using scripts
like Devanagari, Bengali, or Telugu), and, in most cases, Hindi
(Devanagari script) to serve its diverse populations. However, the
absence of standardised guidelines has led to inconsistent design
practices, as observed across the nine metro systems analysed in this
study. Each metro network demonstrates distinct approaches to linguistic
hierarchy, typography, and spatial organisation. By creating fragmented
and unpredictable visual environments, these inconsistencies risk
increasing the cognitive load on passengers, which can lead to confusion
and hinder efficient wayfinding.

### Research goals and methods

This study analyses the integration of the Devanagari script within
multilingual wayfinding systems across nine Indian metro networks. It
examines variations in script prioritisation, typographic elements (such
as typeface selection and text alignment), and visual coherence,
evaluating their consistency with established design principles for
transportation systems.

To support this analysis, a substantial collection of visual data was
gathered from multiple sources, including photographs taken by family
and friends, online images, and still frames from metro station [tour
videos](#sn:sn2). While direct, in-person observations in India were not
possible, these combined sources provided a diverse dataset sufficient
for examining the signage design.

The following section presents detailed descriptions of each system’s
directional signage, followed by a comparative summary of key
characteristics.

## Descriptive analysis of the metro system directional signage

### 1. Pune

Pune Metro, operational since 2022, serves the cities of Pune and
Pimpri-Chinchwad, one of Maharashtra’s major and rapidly growing urban
centres. Its directional signage incorporates three languages: Marathi
(in the Devanagari script), Hindi (in the Devanagari script), and
English (in the Latin script). Marathi, the regional language, is
included to reflect the area’s linguistic identity. The inclusion of
Hindi caters to the Hindi-speaking immigrant population, while English
accommodates non-Hindi speakers and international visitors.

### 2. Nagpur

Nagpur Metro, operational since 2019, uses a multilingual approach
similar to Pune with signs in Marathi (in the Devanagari script), Hindi
(in the Devanagari script), and English (in the Latin script).

### 3. Bengaluru (Namma Metro)

Namma Metro initially implemented a trilingual signage system
incorporating Kannada (in the Kannada script), Hindi (in the Devanagari
script), and English (in the Latin script). Following local opposition
to perceived Hindi imposition, the current system retains only Kannada
and English, eliminating Devanagari script ([Times of India,
2017](#ref:times-2017)).

### 4. Hyderabad

Hyderabad Metro integrates four languages and scripts in its signage:
Telugu (in the Telugu script), English (in the Latin script), Hindi (in
the Devanagari script), and Urdu (in the Arabic [script)](#sn:sn3). Telugu and
English are prioritised at the top of signage panels with larger font
sizes, reflecting Hyderabad’s status as a technology hub and its
Telugu-speaking majority. Text alignment varies by script: Telugu and
Hindi are right-aligned, while English and, notably, Urdu are
left-aligned, which is unconventional for the typically right-to-left
Arabic script. Thick red and blue lines separate language pairs, with
thinner white lines distinguishing destination information.

### 5. Mumbai

Mumbai Metro’s wayfinding system includes Marathi (in the Devanagari
script), Hindi (in the Devanagari script), and English (in the Latin
script), mirroring the linguistic diversity of India’s financial
capital. Marathi and Hindi are given equal visual priority, presented
with the same heavy font weight and size, and separated by a thick red
line. English is placed below in a lighter font weight, suggesting a
secondary position in the intended linguistic hierarchy. However, this
hierarchy is undermined when the English word ‘EXIT’ is rendered in all
capital letters. This creates a typographic conflict, as capitalisation
is used to signal importance, which directly contradicts the lower
priority suggested by the lighter font weight and subordinate placement.

A further complication arises on exit gate directional signs, as
essential supplementary details (including gate numbers and specific
location information) are presented solely in English, making this
information unavailable to users relying only on Marathi or Hindi.
Furthermore, text alignment is inconsistent across different signs,
varying between left-aligned and seemingly arbitrary placements. This
adds to the spatial disorganisation and visual complexity, leaving users
without a predictable starting point for reading. A notable efficiency,
however, is the practice of writing a word like ‘घाटकोपर’ (Ghatkopar)
only once when it is identical in both Marathi and Hindi. Despite this,
the combination of conflicting typographic signals, information gaps,
and erratic alignment contributes to a confusing wayfinding experience.

### 6. Kolkata

Kolkata Metro, India’s oldest metro system, uses a trilingual wayfinding
system that includes Bengali (in the Bengali script), Hindi (in the
Devanagari script), and English (in the Latin script). However, the
signage presents a confusing layout with no clear language priority. The
languages are arranged with Bengali on the left and Hindi on the right,
both stacked vertically, with the platform name in a larger size on top
and the train destination below in a smaller size. English text appears
below, not stacked, with the platform name and train destination on the
same line, with the former in a larger size. Notably, the English text
is in all capital letters making it appear more prominent. The text
alignment adds to the visual complexity: Bengali text is left-aligned,
Hindi text is right-aligned, and English text is centred across the
bottom.

### 7. Ahmedabad

Ahmedabad Metro, serving Ahmedabad and Gandhinagar, uses a trilingual
system with Gujarati, Hindi (Devanagari), and English (Latin scripts).
Notably, the wayfinding system was designed by the National Institute of
Design (NID), one of India’s premier design institutions ([Metro Rail
News, 2017](#ref:metro-rail-2017)).
This makes the presence of certain typographic inconsistencies
particularly striking. For instance, vertical spacing between languages
can be erratic, as seen on a ‘No Exit’ sign where Gujarati and Hindi are
tightly spaced while ample room is left below the English text.

### 8. Lucknow

Lucknow Metro employs a bilingual wayfinding system with Hindi (in the
Devanagari script) and English (in the Latin script), and unlike Mumbai
Metro, it provides destination information in both languages on its exit
signs. A notable inconsistency, however, is the typographic treatment on
some specific signs. On the smaller, silver signs in particular, the
typeface has been horizontally scaled, causing a vertically compressed
appearance.

### 9. Delhi

Delhi Metro, India’s largest and most comprehensive metro system, uses a
bilingual wayfinding system with Hindi (in the Devanagari script) and
English (in the Latin script). This approach caters for both the local
Hindi-speaking population and the city’s English-speaking residents and
visitors.

## Comparative analysis of Indian metro system directional signage

The following comparative table summarises the key characteristics
identified across the nine metro systems.

Consistent with the article’s primary focus on the Devanagari script,
the Devanagari typeface for each of the nine metro systems has been
[identified](#sn:sn4). A typographic analysis of every corresponding Latin and
regional script typeface, however, is beyond the scope of this study.
Consequently, non-Devanagari typefaces are identified only under
specific circumstances: when the information was officially provided,
was readily available from public sources, or when the typeface choice
itself is central to a key analytical point, as with Nagpur’s use of a
single font family across all scripts.

To clarify the analytical terminology used, the Alignment column is
defined as follows:

- *Direction-based* refers to systems where text aligns with the
  indicated direction
- *Script-specific* describes systems where alignment rules vary by
  script
- *Opposite direction* refers to systems where text aligns opposite to
  the indicated direction.
- *Inconsistent* is used where no uniform strategy was discernible.

The typefaces used are Hind and Kohinoor designed by Indian Type Foundry (see <a href="#ref:adobe-fonts-itf">Adobe Fonts, n.d.</a>; <a href="#ref:google-fonts-itf">Google Fonts,n.d.</a>), Mangal designed by Raghunath Joshi (see <a href="#ref:microsoft-2022">Microsoft Typography, 2022</a>), Mukta designed by Ek Type (see <a href="#ref:google-fonts-ek-type">Google Fonts, n.d.</a>), and Yogesh designed by the GIST group at CDAC (Mumbai) (see <a href="#ref:salrc">South Asia Language Resource Center, n.d.</a>).

## Conclusion

The analysis of nine Indian metro systems provides critical insights
into the integration of Devanagari script within multilingual and
multi-script wayfinding signage. Three overarching themes emerge:

### Linguistic Diversity and Script Harmonisation

All systems employ multilingual signage (2–4 languages), reflecting
India’s linguistic plurality. While Devanagari (for Hindi and regional
languages) coexists with Latin, Bengali, Telugu, and Naskh, its
harmonisation with other scripts is inconsistent. For example, Mumbai
Metro’s singular representation of identical Marathi/Hindi words reduces
clutter but lacks universal adoption, while Kolkata Metro’s chaotic
alignment undermines readability.

### Hierarchical Tensions and Cultural Dynamics

Systems prioritise scripts differently: regional languages (e.g.,
Marathi in Pune) often dominate through size and positioning, while
others (e.g., Delhi) grant equal status to Hindi and English. Political
influences further shape these hierarchies, as seen in Bengaluru’s
removal of Hindi. These variations reflect unresolved tensions between
regional identity, national policies, and global accessibility.

### Typographic Inconsistencies

The practical application of typography reveals numerous
inconsistencies:

**Typefaces:** Typeface selection reveals a fundamental split between reliance on legacy system fonts and the adoption of modern typographic solutions. The majority of metros fall into the former category, primarily using variants of Yogesh, a Devanagari typeface from the 1980s widely adopted for public signage. Bengaluru also followed this approach, using the common system font Mangal for its now-removed Hindi text. In contrast, a few systems use contemporary fonts through two distinct strategies. Nagpur achieves consistency with the unified Mukta typeface for all languages, while Ahmedabad mixes modern fonts for each script: Kohinoor (Devanagari), Mukta (Gujarati), and Hind (Latin). The coexistence of these legacy, unified, and mixed-font strategies underscores a profound lack of standardisation.

**Alignment:** A range of alignment strategies is observed across the systems. The most common approach is direction-based alignment, where text is justified in the same direction the sign indicates, as seen in Pune, Nagpur, Bengaluru, Lucknow, and Delhi. Other systematic but less common methods include Ahmedabad’s opposite direction rule and Hyderabad’s script-specific alignment. In contrast, both Mumbai and Kolkata feature inconsistent layouts that vary between signs without a discernible system.

**Flawed Differentiation and Distortion:** The inconsistent application of differentiators like spacing and coloured lines often creates visual noise (e.g., Hyderabad). This lack of typographic discipline extends to distorting the letterforms themselves, with Lucknow Metro horizontally scaling its typeface, a practice that severely harms legibility.

These inconsistencies highlight the absence of standardised guidelines for Devanagari-centric multilingual typography. While the script’s structural complexity demands tailored solutions, ad-hoc decisions driven by local pragmatism or politics result in fragmented user experiences. Skilful typography and clear hierarchical structuring can address this issue. Future efforts must prioritise empirical legibility testing, further exploration and development of script-specific typefaces, and flexible frameworks that balance regional preferences with universal accessibility. As India’s urban mobility networks expand, such harmonisation will be critical to ensuring equitable navigation in linguistically diverse spaces.
